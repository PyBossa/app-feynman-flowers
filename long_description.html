        <p>Traditional electronic devices work by moving charge around a circuit.  This has produced astounding results over the last half century, but we are now at a point where further reducing the size of circuit elements is difficult because it would create too much heat in too small a space.</p>

        <p>Our research group is studying magnetic molecules to understand how they can be used to make the smallest possible “spintronic” devices, in which charge (electronic) and spin (magnetic) properties can be used together.  In the future, this would allow us to make devices that can do more and also use less energy.</p>

        <p>As a simple example, we may be able to use the magnetic orientation of one molecule (the direction in which its internal compass needle points) to store a single bit (0 or 1) of information: this would potentially increase the storage density on hard drives by 100x.</p>

        <p>Using a special kind of “microscope”, operating at close to absolute zero temperature and based on the quantum mechanical principle of tunneling, we can measure single molecules on surfaces.</p>

        <p>Many of a molecule’s magnetic properties are determined by how it binds (sticks) to the surface.  For example, a group in Japan found that the magnetic stability energy of a molecule could change by 50% just by a 15˚ rotation in its binding angle.</p>
        <p>It is therefore crucial for us to measure the distribution of binding angles of a particular molecule on a given surface.  This will allow us to compare our results with theoretical predictions to better understand their properties.  That’s where you come in …</p>

        Based on the answer of the users, we will be able to classify the photos, 
        distributing the tasks (thanks to PyBossa) to different users and volunteers.
